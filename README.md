**Quick About Me:**

My name's Kitt(spi)/Korryn/Kloudy

(She/Her) They/Them. He/Him is fine. Cis-Girl.

--------

**One thing you should especially know is that I keep a consistent personality. My actions and/or responses are usually in hand with whom I'm talking to. In other words,

I try to match one another's personality so I  can attempt to make them comfortable with me. This applies to vibe of places and friend groups. 

I am very self-insecure at th moment, so I apologize in advance.

--------

I dislike copying/taking hard inspo. Vice versa as well. If I end up having a similar morph/skin to any of yours, varying on mood, then I could change its design; just ask me.
